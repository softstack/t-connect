# Proof of Concept

To showcase the practical application and versatility of the t:connect SDK, we've developed a Proof of Concept (PoC) in the form of an interactive clicker game. This sample app serves as a tangible example of how developers can leverage t:connect to integrate blockchain functionalities within a Telegram Mini App. By blending gaming elements with blockchain interactions, the PoC demonstrates how to create engaging user experiences that harness the power of the Tezos and Etherlink ecosystems. This section provides detailed insights into deploying the app, its features, and how it exemplifies the seamless integration of Web3 capabilities into mainstream platforms like Telegram.
