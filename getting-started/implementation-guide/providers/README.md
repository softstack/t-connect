# Providers

Provider services enable connection to the Tezos and Etherlink networks. Providers are required to connect an application to a Tezos or Etherlink node, as they facilitate access to data queries, sending transactions, and interacting with smart contracts.

TConnect offers three providers. For Etherlink, you must use the `TConnectEtherlinkProvider`, while the `TConnectTezosBeaconProvider` and `TConnectTezosWcProvider` are recommended for Tezos.
