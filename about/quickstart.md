# Quickstart

We provide four distinct npm packages that can be independently installed and utilized, giving developers the freedom to integrate precisely the functionality they need:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="React-Modal" %}
Install the React-Modal

The react-modal is supplied as a complete package and includes the required providers

```typescript
npm install @tconnect.io/modal
```

This is a complete React component specifically crafted for blockchain wallet connections. It provides a ready-to-use interface that allows users to connect with supported wallets seamlessly. Once connected, it establishes a React context that enables developers to interact directly with blockchain functionalities. Think of it as a smart, pre-built gateway that simplifies the often complex process of wallet integration and blockchain interaction.
