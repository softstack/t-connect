<summary>Q4: What can I do if I use Next.js and have problems loading the modal's images?</summary>

If you're using Next.js and have problems loading the modal's images, make sure to update your `next.config.js` to properly handle image assets. Specifically, add custom Webpack rules to process SVG and PNG files as `asset/resource`and ensure the correct `publicPath` and `outputPath` are set. This helps Next.js locate the images correctly and avoids caching issues or incorrect paths.
